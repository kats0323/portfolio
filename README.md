   # Short Answer Q&A
Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)  

One of the key events in the development of the Internet from the 1980s to today is the birth of TCP / IP. TCP / IP, also known as the Internet Protocol Suite, is the communication protocol that is available on most commercial networks. In 1982, this TCP / IP was standardized, and this brought about the concept of the Internet, and the speed of penetration has risen sharply.

# Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

A web browser is a software program that allows a user to locate, access, and display web pages.
A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients.
Domain is that A group of computers and devices on a network that are administered as a unit with common rules and procedures. Within the Internet, domains are defined by the IP address. All devices sharing a common part of the IP address are said to be in the same domain.
Dns is that because domain names are alphabetic, they're easier to remember. The Internet however, is really based on IP addresses. Every time you use a domain name, therefore, a DNS service must translate the name into the corresponding IP address.

# Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)
In the development of Internet technology, our lives are changing dramatically. One of its contributions is wi-fi. Thanks to wi-fi, you can contact anyone anytime, anywhere. This is a very groundbreaking thing that allows me to keep in touch with my family and friends in Japan every day. Now many people can not live without wi-fi.
